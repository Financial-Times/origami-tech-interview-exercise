# Origami Technical Interview

Use the [securities quotes api](#using-our-securities-quotes-api) (also known as stock prices) to populate a client-side component with their percentage change for the day.

Then, implement an interface to allow the user to set a preference whether to show stock prices as a percentage change for the day or for the week. Update the stocks component when the user makes a selection.

It could look something like the following.
