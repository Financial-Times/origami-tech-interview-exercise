# Origami Technical Excercise 

We would like you to use the [securities quotes api](#using-our-securities-quotes-api) (also known as stock prices) to populate a client-side component with their percentage change for the day. We do not expect any server-side code to be written for this exercise.

An example of how this component could look is below. However, it does not need to look exactly like this.

- Please don't spend more than 1 hour on this exercise.
- We're not expecting you to complete this exercise, do only as much as you can within the time that you have.
- We are more interested in how you work than in how much code you write.
- You can use Google or any other resources you would like.
- We prefer to see solutions which use HTML, JavaScript and Sass/CSS, without using a framework like React or Vue.

## Prerequisites

Running this project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 14.x and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

1. Clone this repository (`Financial-Times/origami-tech-interview-exercise`) to your machine.
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`.

## Using our Securities Quotes API

To fetch the day's percentage change for a security you can use our Securities Quotes API, which is located at https://markets-data-api-proxy.ft.com/research/webservices/securities/v1/quotes.

The Securities Quotes API is a real production API and as such the values in the response will change over time.

Documentation for the Securities Quotes API is below.
